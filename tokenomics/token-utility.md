# Token Utility

The MAZZE token, specifically from the mainnet, serves as the cornerstone of the Mazze ecosystem, crucially driving the platform's functionality and nurturing its community. This token, distinct from the wrapped version on Ethereum prior to the mainnet launch, is intricately woven into the Mazze ecosystem's structure. It provides a diverse range of utilities, from enabling transactions to enhancing network operations and user engagement within the decentralized space. As the primary component of Mazze's blockchain framework, the mainnet's MAZZE token is poised to revolutionize how users interact and contribute within the decentralized space.

The MAZZE token is intricately woven into the fabric of the Mazze ecosystem, providing a versatile utility that enhances the platform's functionality and user engagement. Below is a structured overview of the MAZZE token's utility:

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Transaction Processing and Smart Contract Execution**</mark> | Similar to Ethereum's Ether, MAZZE is used for conducting transactions and executing smart contract code on the Mazze network. Users need MAZZE to pay for transaction fees and computational resources (gas), with fees expressed in MAZZE.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Bonding for Storage Space**</mark> | Users must bond MAZZE tokens to secure storage space on the network. This system aims to discourage unnecessary space occupation and manage network resources efficiently. The required deposit for storage is 0.5 MAZZE per 1 kB of storage.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Miner Rewards and Incentives**</mark> | The Mazze network rewards miners for block generation and maintaining network integrity. Miners earn from three sources: transaction fees paid by users, block rewards from newly created MAZZE tokens, and interest income generated from tokens bonded by users for storage. This model promotes fairer distribution of rewards compared to traditional PoW networks.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Economic and Security Measures**</mark> | The Mazze network uses a unique consensus algorithm with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This design allows efficient integration of concurrent blocks, enhancing security and throughput. The MAZZE token is integral to this system, serving as the primary medium for network transactions and miner rewards.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Block Reward and Inflation Management**</mark> | The network generates new MAZZE tokens as block rewards, contributing to inflation. However, this inflation rate is managed strategically through a scheduled decrease in block rewards, aiming to stabilize the token's value over time.
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Adoption and User Incentives**</mark> | The compatibility with Ethereum's Solidity programming language and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) may facilitate the adoption of Mazze and MAZZE tokens among existing Ethereum developers and users.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Network Incentivization**</mark> | The token incentivizes users to contribute to the network's security and efficiency, rewarding behaviors that support the ecosystem's health and growth.
8. <mark style="color:orange;">**Ecosystem Growth and Sustainability**</mark> | The utility of MAZZE tokens is designed to support the ecosystem's scalability and sustainability, ensuring long-term value for token holders and users alike.
