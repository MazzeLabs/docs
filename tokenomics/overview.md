The native token, MAZZE, is set to revolutionize the ecosystem through a wide array of functionalities. This document outlines the structured information about the project, its native token utility, the strategic approach towards liquidity and community engagement through an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, and the planned transition towards its mainnet launch.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Token Utility of MAZZE**</mark>

The native MAZZE token, integral to the Mazze blockchain, is designed to serve multiple key functions, ensuring the robustness and sustainability of the network. The utilities include:

* **Transaction Processing & Smart Contract Execution**

Prior to the mainnet launch, an ERC20 version of the MAZZE token has been created on the Ethereum network with the same name to initiate a public sale aimed at:

* Community building
* Creating awareness for the project
* Fundraising for development and partnerships
* Generating liquidity
* Ensuring accessibility on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
* Expansion through Centralized Exchanges (CEXs).

#### **Token Distribution**

The total supply of 5,000,000,000 MAZZE tokens is allocated as follows:
