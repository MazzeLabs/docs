# FAQ

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the Mazze blockchain?</mark>

It's a high-performance, high-throughput Proof-of-Work system that differentiates itself by introducing parallel block processing.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the purpose and vision of Mazze?</mark>

Mazze aims to establish a decentralized blockchain platform with robust security and absolute transparency, facilitating high-volume transactions and supporting DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and the creation of DApps (Decentralized Applications) across various sectors.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What characterizes the Mazze public blockchain network?</mark>

Mazze is a permissionless network ensuring full decentralization without central oversight, integrating Proof of Work (PoW) with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure for enhanced scalability and transaction throughput.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the Weighted Graph Ledger (WGL) in Mazze's consensus model?</mark>

WGL is a new solution that integrates a unique block weight system and a DAG-based ledger structure, addressing scalability-security trade-offs and offering robust defense against liveness attacks.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the Weighted Ledger Selection Rule (WLSR) in Mazze?</mark>

WLSR implements a block weighting system where blocks carry weights of 0, 1, or X, promoting throughput in normal conditions and enhancing security during attacks through the generation of more special blocks.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the DAG-Embedded Tree Structure (DETS) in Mazze?</mark>

DETS leverages Mazze's DAG architecture, embedding it within a tree-like structure to enhance ledger security and throughput, and facilitating efficient data integration and concurrent block processing.

### <mark style="color:orange;">How does the consensus process work in Mazze?</mark>

Blocks in WGL are produced rapidly, up to 1 per second, benefiting from the efficient DAG structure and WLSR. The network determines the nature of the blocks, and WGL uses WLSR to select the pivot chain within DETS, maintaining consistency and preventing double-spending.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What are the benefits of Mazze's blockchain technology?</mark>

The benefits include enhanced scalability through rapid block generation and efficient ledger structure, and improved security against various threats.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What are some implementation use cases for Mazze?</mark>

Mazze is suitable for high-throughput, secure cryptocurrency transactions, enterprise blockchain solutions, and decentralized applications requiring a resilient infrastructure.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What are the cornerstones of the existing blockchain world?</mark>

Decentralization, transparency, immutability, smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, interoperability, scalability, and the role of cryptocurrency.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the architecture design of Mazze?</mark>

Mazze features a multilayered design for scalability and security, with a base layer for PoW consensus mechanism and ledger maintenance, and a second layer for high-velocity transactions and smart contract execution.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the data structure used in Mazze's blockchain architecture?</mark>

Mazze uses a DAG-based structure for secure and efficient transaction data storage, enhanced by data pruning and state management strategies for scalability.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What cryptographic techniques are employed in Mazze for security?</mark>

Mazze uses SHA-256 for hashing, and multi-signature wallets, countering risks like 51% attacks, double-spending, and Sybil attacks.

### <mark style="color:orange;">How does Mazze differentiate from Bitcoin and Ethereum?</mark>

Mazze uses parallel block and transaction processing, leading to a singular, linear chain, and implements ongoing maintenance fees for smart contract storage, unlike Ethereum.

### <mark style="color:orange;">How does Mazze incorporate Solidity and Ethereum's EVM?</mark>

Mazze uses Solidity for smart contract programming and is compatible with Ethereum's EVM, enhancing security and performance in smart contract execution.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the throughput capability of Mazze?</mark>

Mazze theoretically can process around 40,000 transactions per second, a significant improvement over Ethereum and Bitcoin.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What distinguishes Mazze's smart contract platform?</mark>

It integrates Solidity, aligns with EVM compatibility, and includes a robust testing and auditing framework for secure, efficient, and scalable smart contract development.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the tokenomics and financial structure of Mazze?</mark>

Mazze uses a PoW network with a DAG structure for parallel block processing, has a system for bonding tokens to secure storage space, and implements a fairer block reward system.

### <mark style="color:orange;">How does the Mazze consensus algorithm utilize the DAG structure?</mark>

The algorithm integrates a block weight system into a DAG-based ledger, improving scalability and security, and enabling efficient integration of concurrent blocks.

### <mark style="color:orange;">What is the daily block generation rate of Mazze?</mark>

Mazze is designed to generate one block per second, resulting in a total of 86,400 blocks daily.
