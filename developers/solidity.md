# Solidity

Solidity is a premier programming language for smart contract development, drawing influences from C++, Python, and JavaScript. It is a statically typed, object-oriented language, tailored for the Mazze blockchain, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible platform. Solidity's design aims for ease of adoption by programmers versed in modern programming languages.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Key Elements of Solidity on Mazze Blockchain</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Pragma Directive**</mark> | Every Solidity file on Mazze blockchain begins with a pragma directive, specifying compatibility with Solidity version 0.4.0 or later. This directive is file-specific, meaning imported files' pragmas don't automatically apply to the importing file. Example: `Pragma solidity ^0.8.2`
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Contracts**</mark> | In Solidity, contracts resemble C++ classes and live at specific addresses on the Mazze blockchain. They encapsulate code and data, with properties including:
   * Constructors: Special functions for contract initiation, executed once per contract upon creation.
   * State Variables: These variables store the contract's state.
   * Functions: Used to modify state variables and hence the contract's state.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Visibility Quantifiers**</mark> | Functions and state variables in a contract have varying visibility, facilitating interactions between contracts.
   * `external`: Functions callable only by other contracts, not internally. Use `this.function_name()` for internal calls. State variables can't be external.
   * `public`: Accessible both externally and internally. Public state variables automatically generate getter functions.
   * `internal`: Only for internal or derived contract use.
   * `private`: Restricted to internal use, inaccessible to derived contracts.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Data Types**</mark> | Solidity supports various data types including Booleans, Integers (int/uint), Addresses (standard and payable for Ether transactions), and String Literals.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Mapping**</mark> | A key-value pair storage mechanism, supporting built-in data types like arrays, enums, and operators. Useful for associating values with specific storage locations.
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Gas**</mark> | A metric indicating the computational effort required for operations on the Mazze blockchain. Each function, operation, or state change in a smart contract incurs a Gas cost.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**ABI**</mark> | The Application Binary Interface in Solidity functions akin to a web API, defining methods and structures for binary contract interactions.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Solidity Contract Development on Mazze Blockchain</mark>

* **Testing and Deployment** | Smart contracts, once deployed, are immutable. Therefore, rigorous testing for bugs and vulnerabilities is crucial. The Hardhat development framework is highly recommended for Solidity development on Mazze, offering ease in compiling, testing, and deploying contracts. It's compatible with major JavaScript APIs like Ether.js and Web3.js.
* **Front End and Web3 Development** | Post contract development, constructing a user-friendly interface is vital for dApp interaction. Web3.js and Ether.js are top libraries for front-end development, simplifying tasks like Ether transactions, smart contract interactions, and more.
