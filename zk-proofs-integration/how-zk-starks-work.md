# How ZK-STARKs Work

Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge (ZK-STARKs) represent a cutting-edge advancement in blockchain technology, offering enhanced privacy and efficiency in digital transactions. Unlike their predecessor, ZK-SNARKs, ZK-STARKs bring forth improvements in key areas, addressing limitations and expanding capabilities in blockchain applications.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**How ZK-STARKs Work: A Technical Overview**</mark>

1. **Proof Generation** | Similar to ZK-SNARKs, in ZK-STARKs, the prover generates a proof to demonstrate knowledge of certain information or the correctness of a computation, without revealing the underlying data or details.
2. **Verifier's Role** | The verifier receives and checks the validity of the proof. The process is designed to be swift and efficient, ensuring quick verifications, which is vital for high-volume blockchain networks.
3. **Cryptographic Techniques** | ZK-STARKs employ a combination of cryptographic algorithms and hash functions, but without the need for elliptic curve pairings. This simplifies the process and enhances security and efficiency.

```python
def generate_proof(computation, input_data, secret): 
""" Generate a ZK-STARK proof for a given computation.
:param computation: The computation or transaction to be proven.
:param input_data: Public input data for the computation.
:param secret: Secret data or witness that proves the computation is correct.
:return: A proof object.
"""

# Step 1: Represent the computation as a polynomial
polynomial = convert_computation_to_polynomial(computation, input_data, secret)

# Step 2: Use FRI protocol to create a commitment to the polynomial
commitment = FRI_commit(polynomial)

# Step 3: Generate a proof that the polynomial satisfies the computation
proof = generate_polynomial_proof(polynomial, commitment)

return proof
```

```python
def generate_proof(computation, input_data, secret):
    """
    Generate a ZK-STARK proof for a given computation.

    :param computation: The computation or transaction to be proven.
    :param input_data: Public input data for the computation.
    :param secret: Secret data or witness that proves the computation is correct.
    :return: A proof object.
    """

    # Step 1: Represent the computation as a polynomial
    polynomial = convert_computation_to_polynomial(computation, input_data, secret)

    # Step 2: Use FRI protocol to create a commitment to the polynomial
    commitment = FRI_commit(polynomial)

    # Step 3: Generate a proof that the polynomial satisfies the computation
    proof = generate_polynomial_proof(polynomial, commitment)

    return proof
```
